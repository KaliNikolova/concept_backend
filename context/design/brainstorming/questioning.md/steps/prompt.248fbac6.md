# prompt: for this one

  // NOTE: A sync would be needed to create this on UserAccount.register

  async createUserTasks({ user }: { user: User }): Promise<Empty> {

    // This action might be used to initialize things for a new user.

    // In this case, there's nothing to do, but it's a good pattern.

    return {};

  }
